## Overview
This Calendar App allows users to manage their events efficiently. The app is built with modern web technologies like React.js, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## [Vercel App Link :  https://event-calender-nahsik16s-projects.vercel.app/](https://event-calender-nahsik16s-projects.vercel.app/)  
## Features
- **Calendar View**:
        - Display a calendar grid for the current month with all days properly aligned.
        - Allow users to switch between months using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- **Event Management**:
        - Add events by clicking on a day.
        - Edit or delete events from a selected day.
        - Each event should include:
            - Event name
            - Start time and end time
            - Optional description
- **Event List**:
        - Display a list of all events for the selected day in a modal or side panel.
- **Data Persistence**:
        - UseÂ **localStorage**Â or a simple in-memory data store to persist events between page refreshes.
- **Complex Logic**:
    - Automatically handle month transitions (e.g., from Jan 31 to Feb 1).
    - Prevent overlapping events (e.g., two events at the same time).
    - Allow filtering of events by keyword.
- **Bonus Feature**:
    - Allow users to export the event list for a specific month as aÂ **JSON**Â orÂ **CSV**Â file.
